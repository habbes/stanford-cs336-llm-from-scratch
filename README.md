# Language Modeling from Scratch

This repo contains my assignment attempts and notes from **Stanford's CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch**.

- Course lectures playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOY23Y0BoGoBGgQ1zmU_MT_
- Course website (schedule, assignments, slides, etc.): https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2025/

Each assignment's folder was created by manually copying from the corresponding official repo of the assignment.
I'm not using submodules. This means if fixes are made to the official repo and I want to pull them,
I'd have to copy them over manually. (TODO: consider creating forks and submodules).

- Assignment 1:
    - [Local folder](./assignment1-basics/)
    - [Official repository](https://github.com/stanford-cs336/assignment1-basics)
